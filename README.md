**Ranges** provides a range type for each primitive integer type. Ranges can be intersected, unioned and coalesced. The range types correspond to integer types as follows:
- `Range8`: `Byte` / `byte`
- `SRange8`: `SByte` / `sbyte`
- `Range16`: `Int16` / `short`
- `URange16`: `UInt16` / `ushort`
- `Range32`: `Int32` / `int`
- `URange32`: `UInt32` / `uint`
- `Range64`: `Int64` / `long`
- `URange64`: `UInt64` / `ulong`
